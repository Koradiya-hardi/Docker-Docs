                <p>In publishing and graphic design, Lorem ipsum (/ˌlɔː.rəm ˈɪp.səm/) is a placeholder text
                     commonly used to demonstrate the visual form of a document or a typeface without relying
                      on meaningful content. Lorem ipsum may be used as a placeholder before final copy is 
                      available. It is also used to temporarily replace text in a process called greeking, 
                      which allows designers to consider the form of a webpage or publication, without the 
                      meaning of the text influencing the design.</p>

               <p> Lorem ipsum is typically a corrupted version of De finibus bonorum et 
                malorum, a 1st-century BC text by the Roman statesman and philosopher 
                Cicero, with words altered, added, and removed to make it nonsensical and 
                improper Latin. The first two words themselves are a truncation of dolorem 
                ipsum ("pain itself").</p>

                mid-1980s, when Aldus employed it in graphic and word-processing templates 
                for its desktop publishing program PageMaker. Other popular word processors, 
                including Pages and Microsoft Word, have since adopted Lorem ipsum,[2] as
